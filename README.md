# PyDuskers
Strategic game inspired by [Duskers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/254320/Duskers/)

## How to play?
* You can give it a try online [via Replit](https://replit.com/@fipachu/PyDuskers?v=1).
* For best experience and the ability to save properly download [this folder](Duskers/task/duskers) and run file duskers.py with Python.
I developed the game using CPython 3.12 so it's your safest bet, but 3.11 should work too (it's what I use on Replit).


Version 1.0.0 is made to [Hyperskill specification](https://hyperskill.org/projects/136). 
Currently I have no plans to expand the game further, but if you find a bug or have feature suggestions,
feel free to open a new issue. I make no promises, but hey, maybe one day I'll get inspired to work on this game again.
